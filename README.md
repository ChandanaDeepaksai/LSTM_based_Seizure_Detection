## Seizure Detection Project

This seizure detection project is designed to classify EEG data into five categories using a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) model. The aim is to enhance the accuracy and reliability of seizure detection by capturing temporal dependencies in EEG signals. By using BiLSTM, the model processes information from both past and future sequences, making it well-suited for understanding complex patterns in EEG data.
